    "The SPI communication is short for Serial Peripheral Interface. Just like UART, I2C, CAN and other serial transfer, the SPI transfer data using a single line. Take note that it transfers the data through a single line but it doesn't mean that it only needs a single line to apply the SPI communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a specification about serial, synchronous and full-duplex communications between a master controller (which is usually implemented with an MCU or something with programmable functionalities) and several slave devices. As we will see next, the nature of the SPI interface allows full duplex as well as half duplex communications over the same bus. SPI specification is a de facto standard, and it was defined by Motorola¹ in late ‘70, and it is still\n",
    "largely adopted as communication protocol for many digital ICs.\n",

    "\n",
    "## CS\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll discuss one of the key differences of the SPI over the I2C. The SPI master selects which slave to be communicated by pulling the chip select low. Now, the chip select line is unique for every peripheral. What this means is if you have 16 sensors connected to the same SPI line, it also means that you have 16 different GPIO_Output pins that will serve as the Chip Select for every SPI device. All the 16 devices will share the MOSI and MISO line but will have a unique chip select line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike for the I2C, the SPI doesn't use any address to start communication but only pulls the Chip Select of the device it wanted to communicate. Finally, the Chip Select line is active LOW, which means it is low when ACTIVE or the data transmission is on going.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full Duplex and Other Advantages also Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPI can transmit data at a higher speed compared to the I2C and with less power. However, the transmission line must be within 20 cm distance, that is, you can't have a really long wire and expect to have a working SPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full Duplex mode is a fancy term that means that the master can transmit and receive at the same time. Full duplex doesn't only mean that the periphercal \"can\" transmit at the same time but it \"needs\" to transmit at the same time. Basically, the first bit the that is sent \n",
    "\n",
    "## No ACK\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the I2C communication, the SPI doesn't have an acknowledge implementation. It means that you can transmit or receive to the SPI line without having any device connected to it. The acknowledge implementation is used so that the master will have a way to know that the data transfer was sent succesfully which the SPI doesn't implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Master and his SCK\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the SPI allows full duplex, doesn't mean that the slave can just send data to the master. The master has the FULL control of the line. Now, the master has only one-way of starting communication (apart from pulling the chip select of the specific device), that is, to start the SCK pulsing or counting. The state of SCK is determined by the Polarity (could be either HIGH or LOW), which means if the master is not communicating the line is always set to HIGH or LOW (depending on the Polarity set). If the master wishes to start communicating then the SCK will start pulsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the Polarity, we also have a Phase parameter for SCK which determines which edge of the clock should we determine the measurements. This is important since some slave devices has a specific Polarity and Phase and hence the Master must first configure the SPI Protocol to have the same configuration with the said device. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the SCK on some devices has a limit and must be accounted for the communication to work properly. \n",
