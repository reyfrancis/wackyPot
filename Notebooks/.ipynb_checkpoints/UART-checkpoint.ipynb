    "# UART\n",
    "\n",
    "UART is the short for Universal Asynchronous Serial Communication. Nowadays there is a really high number of serial communication protocols and hardware interfaces available in the electronics industry. The most of them are focused on high transmission bandwidths, like the more recent USB 2.0 and 3.0 standards, the Firewire (IEEE 1394) and so on. Some of\n",
    "these standards come from the past, but are still widespread especially as communication interface between modules on the same board. One of this is the Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter interface, also simply known as USART.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of UART and other serial line communication arises from the parallel data transmission problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![parallel_communication.PNG](UART_Images/parallel_communication.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we can pass an 8-bit data using 1-clock pulse but it needs to have 8 data lines or wires. In fact, these communication requires 9 data lines since we have to alot 1 line for the ground reference. By this idea, 16-bit data means 17 data lines and 32-bit data means 33 data lines. This is too much for a microcontroller just for sending a data across a line. Hence, serial communications were invented. \n",

    "\n",
    "A 16-bit data is sent through a single data line and each data sent is measured by a specific clock pulse both synchronized at the transmitter and receiver. Hence, a 16-bit data requires 16 clock pulses as opposed to a single clock pulse for parallel communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronous or Asynchronous\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've discussed above, using a single data line means we need to have a synchronized clock pulses both at the transmitter nd the receiver. We could also have an asynchronous communication using a single data line, that is, it doesn' require a clock. To configure this communication, we have 3 parameters to set\n",

    "\n",
    "![start_stop_bits.PNG](UART_Images/start_stop_bits.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the start and stop bits are just some predefined HIGH or LOW's in the data line. For example, in the image, the data line was always HIGH and then a sudden LOW. This marked the START of the communication. All the other combination of bits that are sent to the Rx will be processed by the Rx clock alone, that is, the Rx has to measure on it's own the clock pulse and measure if the bit sent is a HIGH or a LOW. Again, this will only work if both the transmitter and receiver has the same clock pulse speed. After everything was sent a HIGH is sent to the data line marking the STOP bit. Keep in mind that the STOP bit is not really necessary since the receiver already know how many clock pulses it would take until the last bit was sent (data length * clock pulses = number of total clock pulses). \n",

    "The 9600 baud rate is perhaps the most used baud rate. Baud rate basically means bit per second. Hence, a 9600 baud rate means there are 9600 bits sent in the data line in 1 second. By dividing 1 second by 9600 bits, we'll get 104 us. This means each bit is sent at 104 us interval. \n",

If you are a familiar with Python, you might know that array holds a bunch of stuffs together. In C++, arrays doesn't hold anything. It's an address of a collection of variables in some order. For example, we want our microcontroller to send a message specifically : Hello Word. We know that a computer only communicates with a bunch of 1's and 0's. So we start by setting how many bits we want to send over a data line.
