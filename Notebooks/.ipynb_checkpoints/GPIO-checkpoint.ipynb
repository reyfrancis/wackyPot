    "This is equivalent to 1 byte. It means if we have a USB drive of 1 byte, we can only store any combination of 8-bit binary. Suppose we want to use this USB to store a number in decimal system, then we have to find the number of possible combinations there is in 8-bit binary. Each binary is consist of either 1 or 0, hence, each binary digit consist of 2 combinations. This means for 8 digit binary, we have $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^8 = 256$ combinations of decimal number. \n",

    "A memory region is quite a confusing idea. In our usb, we can store any value from 0xFF to 0x00 (0b11111111 to 0b00000000). Suppose that we want to find the maximum number of combinations we can store to the usb but we don't know how much storage there is, rather we are given the memory region, that is, 0xFF to 0x00. It makes sense that we must subtract these two hex numbers and the (resulting difference + 1) determines how big is the storage. Hence, "
