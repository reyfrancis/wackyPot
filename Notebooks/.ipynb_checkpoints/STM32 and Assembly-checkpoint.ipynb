A processor has many thousands of registers that are not visible to the programmer. However, when we talk about the registers that are available to the programmer we refer to the registers that we use as a scratchpad memory or short term memory. This registers are located very close to the processors ALU and they are designed to be very fast at the expense of using more power and more transistors. \n",

    "Then, we also have the memory associated with the processor. Typically, there are two main types of memory, the flash memory is where the program memory is stored. It is a non volatile memory which mean the contents are preserved even if the power is turned off and then immediately avaiable when the power is turned back on.  The next type variables are called RAM. Most of the variables that will be used by the programmer will be stored in RAM. The contents of RAM will be undefined when power is turned on. \n",

    "Unlike other desktop programming language such as Python, C++ and C are built to use pointers but this is not because pointers are defines C/C++. Pointers were built out of necessity in order to program controllers and microcontrollers such as STM32. Most of the microcontrollers store registers. Registers are just the variables in a specific memory location of the microcontroller. Keep in mind, that we don't write to registers in a way that we equate them to some values. Instead, the memory location of these registers are given in the datasheet and then we write the values, oftentimes we don't physically write the values but we apply logical operations such as OR, AND, XOR, etc. For example, let's say we have the register REGM. And according to the datasheet, it's memory location is 0x0A. If we want to set it's bits such that the we set the LSB to be 1 and all the other bits to be zero (Assuming that these register is 8 bit for simplicity sake)."
