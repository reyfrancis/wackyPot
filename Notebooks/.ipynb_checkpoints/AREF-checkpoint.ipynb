    "# AREF\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common misconception to think of AREF as a separate ground plane to use to have a more accurate ADC readings. For beginners, AREF seems to be the voltage reference to the microcontroller, that is, whatever noise there in the power supply, the AREF or the voltage reference from the microcontroller is not affected and our ADC reading would be much better. We'll there are few good points in this; however, this definition of AREF is not completely correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, AREF is not used to get a better accurate reading with respect to noises. Yes, the AREF schematic is properly filtered depending on what kind of processor you are using. However, the main purpose of AREF is explained here:\n",

    "## Why 3.22 millivolts?\n",

    "This is due to the resolution of the ADC. The resolution (for this article) is the degree to which something can be represented numerically. The higher the resolution, the greater accuracy with which something can be represented. We measure resolution in the terms of the number of bits of resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 1-bit resolution would only allow two (two to the power of one) values – zero and one. A 2-bit resolution would allow four (two to the power of two) values – zero, one, two and three. If we tried to measure  a five volt range with a two-bit resolution, and the measured voltage was four volts, our ADC would return a numerical value of 3 – as four volts falls between 3.75 and 5V. It is easier to imagine this with the following image:\n",

    "\n",
    "So with our example ADC with 2-bit resolution, it can only represent the voltage with four possible resulting values. If the input voltage falls between 0 and 1.25, the ADC returns numerical 0; if the voltage falls between 1.25 and 2.5, the ADC returns a numerical value of 1. And so on. With our Arduino’s ADC range of 0~1023 – we have 1024 possible values – or 2 to the power of 10. So our Arduinos have an ADC with a 10-bit resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So basically what is AREF?\n",
    "\n",
    "To cut a long story short, when your Arduino takes an analogue reading, it compares the voltage measured at the analogue pin being used against what is known as the reference voltage. In normal analogRead use, the reference voltage is the operating voltage of the board. For the more popular Arduino boards such as the Uno, Mega, Duemilanove and Leonardo/Yún boards, the operating voltage of 5V. If you have an Arduino Due board, the operating voltage is 3.3V. If you have something else – check the Arduino product page or ask your board supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have a reference voltage of 5V, each unit returned by analogRead() is valued at 0.00488 V. (This is calculated by dividing 1024 into 5V). What if we want to measure voltages between 0 and 2, or 0 and 4.6? How would the ADC know what is 100% of our voltage range?\n",
    "\n",
    "And therein lies the reason for the AREF pin. AREF means Analogue REFerence. It allows us to feed the Arduino a reference voltage from an external power supply. For example, if we want to measure voltages with a maximum range of 3.3V, we would feed a nice smooth 3.3V into the AREF pin – perhaps from a voltage regulator IC. Then the each step of the ADC would represent around 3.22 millivolts (divide 1024 into 3.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the lowest reference voltage you can have is 1.1V. There are two forms of AREF – internal and external, so let’s check them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have a similar answer from arduino stack exchange:\n",
